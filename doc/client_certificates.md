# FAIRagro middleware client certificates

FAIRagro middleware clients require a client certificate for authentication authorization.

Creating new certificates require access to the CA (certification authority) database that is stored
in FAIRagro nextcloud.

For a detailed description of the FAIRagro CA, please refer to the corresponding README file on
nextcloud.
